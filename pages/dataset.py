    The original source of this dataset is provided by Spotifyâ€™s music API. This dataset contains \
    information on thousands of albums, artists, and tracks that are on \
    the Spotify platform. In addition, the dataset also contains lower-level audio features of the tracks, \
    as well as song lyrics. However, due to the huge dataset size, we have to select a portion of data from this \
    dataset to perform analysis. We leverage this sampled dataset for our project to conduct data analyses \
    and showcase this Streamlit application.")

    advanced back in the 21st century and many tracks are not well-documented compared to modern time. \
    Though the release time is not balanced enough, this does not interfere with our analysis since we can \
    still analzye tracks ranging for more than 20 years, which is still a long timespan.")
