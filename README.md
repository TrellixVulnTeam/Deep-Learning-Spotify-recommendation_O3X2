# IDS_Final_Project

This code template is based upon the [Multi-Page App repo](https://github.com/dataprofessor/multi-page-app).

To get started, clone this repo and run the following to install the required packages:

``pip install -r requirements.txt``

## File Structure
The ``app.py`` is the main entry point of our web app. It consists of several apps (features). We can create each of our features inside the ``apps`` folder (``popularity.py``, ``lyrics.py``, ``audio.py``) and then instantiate them inside ``app.py``.

Some examples of features are inside the ``reference_apps`` folder.
